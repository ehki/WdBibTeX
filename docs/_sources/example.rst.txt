Example
=======

Examples are placed in the ``examples`` directory of WdBibTeX project.
Target MS Word file is generated by executing ``docxgen.py`` in each examples directory.


One citation in ieeetr style
----------------------------

Simple example is in ``examples/example1`` directory.
Firstly, execute ``docxgen.py`` to generate ``sample.docx``.
(This is because adding docx in download page is not preferred way to deliver.)
If ``docxgen.py`` fails to generate ``sample.docx``, copy&paste following text to the word file nad save as ``sample.docx``.

.. code-block:: text

    This sample document is generated by WdBibTeX version 0.1.

    Some text with dummy citation \cite{enArticle1} will be converted to [1] by executing wdbibtex.
    The list of bibliography is placed to the thebibliography command as follows:

    \thebibliography

The generated ``sample.docx`` contains one citation key of \\cite{enArticle1}. At the bottom of documents, another latex command of \\thebibliography is placed.
In ``examples/example1``, you can see bibliography file named ``library.bib``.
The BibTeX entry of ``enArticle1`` is in ``library.bib``.

Then, excecute following command with ``--bst ieeetr`` option (as no .bst file is placed in ``examples/example1`` directory).

.. code-block:: sh

    $ python -m wdbibtex sample.docx --bst ieeetr

You can see ``sample_bib.docx`` with the following BibTeX-converted contents:

.. code-block:: text

    This sample document is generated by WdBibTeX version 0.1.
    
    Some text with dummy citation[1] will be converted to [1].
    The list of bibliography is placed to the thebibliography command as follows:
    
    [1]	I. Yamada, J. Yamada, S. Yamada, and S. Yamada, “Title1,” Japanese Journal, vol. 15, pp. 20-30, march 2019.


Citation in IEEJtran style
--------------------------

As the author also maintains IEEJtran.bst(https://github.com/ehki/jIEEEtran), which is BibTeX style files for Japanese Electrical Engineers, one example for Japanese bibliography is stated here.
Although the point is LaTeX and BibTeX command selection, WdBibTeX automatically select proper command based on system locale.

One example for Japanese reference is located in ``examples/example2``.
Note that IEEJtran.bst is already place in the sample directory and WdBibTeX uses the existing .bst file automatically.
The following contents are automatically written in ``sample.docx`` by executing ``docxgen.py``.

.. code-block:: text

    This sample document is generated by WdBibTeX version 0.1.
    
    Sample citation\cite{enArticle1}.
    英語文献の引用例\cite{enArticle1}。
    Multiple citatoins example\cite{enArticle2,enArticle3,enArticle4}.
    複数文献の引用例\cite{enArticle2,enArticle3,enArticle4}。
    Examples of Japanese reference\cite{jpArticle2,jpArticle3,jpArticle4}.
    日本語文献の引用例\cite{jpArticle2,jpArticle3,jpArticle4}。
    The list of bibliography is placed to the thebibliography command as follows:
    文献リストは以下の通りとなる。
    
    \thebibliography

Then, let's excecute following command in ``examples/example2`` directory.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ python -m wdbibtex sample.docx

You can see ``sample_bib.docx`` with the following BibTeX-converted contents:

.. code-block:: text

    This sample document is generated by WdBibTeX version 0.1.

    Sample citation[1].
    英語文献の引用例[1]。
    Multiple citations example[2-4].
    複数文献の引用例[2-4]。
    Examples of Japanese reference[5,6].
    日本語文献の引用例[5,6]。
    The list of bibliography is placed to the thebibliography command as follows:
    文献リストは以下の通りとなる。

    [1]	I. Yamada, J. Yamada, S. Yamada, S. Yamada: “Title1”, Japanese Journal, Vol.15, No.10, pp.20—30 (2019-3) (in Japanese)
    [2]	G. Yamada, R. Yamada: “Title2”, Japanese Journal, Vol.15, No.10, p.21 (2019-12) (in Japanese)
    [3]	G. Yamada, R. Yamada: “Title2 is true?”, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (2018-11)

Some readers noticed that the inserted citation numbers and thebibliography texts did not overwrite the text style.
So by setting the style of \thebibliography and \cite keys before WdBibTeX process, you can set indentation, text-size, font, superscript, etc. of the converted bibliography texts.
